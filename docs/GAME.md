# Novacube – Design Document

## Introduction
Novacube is an open-world sandbox game where players explore a fantasy world, gather resources, build structures, and shape the environment alone or with others.

## Core game loop
Explore → Gather → Build → Defend → Repeat

## Player fantasy
Players should feel powerful, in control of their own living part of the world, and meaningfully connected to other players or NPCs.

## Design pillars
- Performance over visual fidelity.
- Simple to play, deep to master.
- Player customization over predefined content.

## Platform constraints
Novacube is developed Android-first. All gameplay, performance targets, and technical decisions must be viable on mid to low-end Android devices, released from 2020 onwards. Novacube can also run on Windows and Linux desktops with the expected user experience upgrades.
